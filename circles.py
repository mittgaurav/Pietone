    For n points with A-Z tags, find
    max number of points that can be
    be inside any circle centered at
    (0. 0)

1. strings - easy but several edge cases
2. circles - medium but needs optimal data structure
3. matrices - medium

Overall - problem statements are time consuming. The actual solutions are easier but need to check for edge conditions.
